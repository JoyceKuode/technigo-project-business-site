# Business Site

The aim of this project was to demonstrate competency in creating and designing a form within the context of a business site. 

I chose to use a real business run by a real person I know. My goal was to try to improve on a concept that already existed and to try to realize the company's vision. My approach was to first invite the business owner over for coffee (in this case, the business is my husband's former cover band, and the band leader is also our friend who lives across the street from us). We brainstormed necessary features for this new and improved website, and he showed me websites of other bands and shared which elements of those sites that he liked. 

I used ChatGPT whenever I had an idea for something that I didn't know how to implement. For instance, my client asked if I could make the logo rotate 360 degrees. I had no idea if that was even possible, but ChatGPT showed me some code that I tested and it worked. I got other ideas from class meetings and the labs we did with our team about how to create different text effects or use videos as a background. I also used some techniques from last week's project, like using flexbox and grid to create the layout.

If I had more time, I would spend more time with the styling, like experiment with different fonts. I would also really like to update the reviews boxes so that on mobile, maybe it only fits 4 or 5 boxes, but as the screen is enlarged, more boxes are added and they can pop up in a different grid design where some boxes can be different shapes.
